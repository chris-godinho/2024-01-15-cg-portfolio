        Among my biggest (non-technical) passions are trivia (don't ever call me when Jeopardy! is on), card games (I have been playing Magic: The Gathering for almost 30 years), dogs (all of them - I like cats too but I'm quite allergic to them) and the occasional run when the weather and schedule allow.
